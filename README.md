The implementation creates a proper Hilbert Tree with insertRect. It has the following deviations from the spec at this point:

* Not using correct Hilbert Values. Easy fix since I already have code to generate them.
* Possibly some of my nodes are not sorted as per the spec.
* Not reading in from provided file.
